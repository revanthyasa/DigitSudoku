# DigitSudoku
This project is an interactive Sudoku solver web application where users can upload an image of a Sudoku puzzle, which is then processed and digitized for solving. It features a React-based frontend, a backend for image processing, and real-time validation, with options for manual entry, solving, and undo functionality.
